- **Cost Optimization**
  - Burstable SKU for PostgreSQL Server: This setting configures the PostgreSQL server with the Standard_B1ms SKU, a burstable VM type (meaning that the server can “burst” to higher levels to support occasional spikes in usage). This setup optimizes costs by allocating resources dynamically.
  - Basic SKU for Azure Container Registry: The ACR’s SKU is set to Basic in the dev and UAT environments, which reduces costs for non-critical workloads while still supporting required container operations.
  - Environment-Specific Parameters: Beneficial because it allows environment specific parameters to ensure that non-production environments use less expensive resources, (ex: flask_debug is set to 0 in non production environments) while still offering flexibility in the prod environment.

- **Performance Efficiency**
  - Parameterized Deployments with Bicep: Adapts deployments to specific environment needs, without requiring manual changes.
  - Always-On is set to true for the backend app-service-container: This keeps the application pre-warmed, meaning that the load balancer is provisioned to be able to distribute resources as it anticipates a surge in traffic. This reduces latency for users.
  - Application insights monitoring: Integrated for all environments to monitor application performance metrics and identify bottlenecks, allowing for proactive optimization.
  - Conduct load testing for SLI 2: Page Load Time and SLI 3: Transaction Processing Time.
  - Optimize scalability of infrastructure to handle peak loads while maintaining performance thresholds.
